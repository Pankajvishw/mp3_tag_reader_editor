That will keep the **box formatting** intact on GitHub and make your repo look more polished.  

If you want, I can now **finalize your README** so it contains:  
- A quick CLI usage table at the top  
- This sample output  
- Both view and edit instructions  

That way it‚Äôs GitHub-ready in one go. Do you want me to do that?
